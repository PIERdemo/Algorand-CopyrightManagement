 # **Decentralized Copyright Management on Algorand Blockchain** 

This project presents a **decentralized** approach to copyright management, specifically focusing on the **Interested Party Information (IPI) system**. The IPI system uniquely identifies rights holders globally, allowing for the tracking of **rights** and their protection. The proposed solution involves representing rights as **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** on-chain, providing **autonomy** to rights holders in managing their NFTs, ensuring **consistency** and avoiding conflicts. ðŸ“œ ðŸŽ¨

### **Implementation Details**
The project is implemented on the **Algorand blockchain**, utilizing **Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs)** to represent rights as NFTs. The **stateful** and **stateless** smart contracts are used to manage the on-chain consistency of created rights. Techniques like **Merkle Trees** and **BitMatrix** are introduced to efficiently verify on-chain whether a right already exists, minimizing computational and memory overhead.
